# NLP Engineering Coding Challenges for Bangladesh Context

This repository contains four coding challenges focused on applying Natural Language Processing techniques to problems relevant to Bangladesh's linguistic landscape and business needs. Each challenge is designed to test different aspects of NLP engineering skills.

## Challenges:

1. Multilingual Named Entity Recognition for Customer Queries
2. Sentiment Analysis for Bangla Product Reviews
3. Code-Mixed Language Detection and Separation
4. Query Intent Classification for Digital Financial Services

## How to Participate:

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new branch for your solution
3. Implement your solution in the appropriate challenge directory
4. Create a pull request to this repository

## Challenge Details:

### 1. Multilingual Named Entity Recognition for Customer Queries
Implement an NER system that can identify key entities in customer queries written in Bangla, English, or code-mixed text.

### 2. Sentiment Analysis for Bangla Product Reviews
Develop a sentiment analysis model for Bangla product reviews on an e-commerce platform.

### 3. Code-Mixed Language Detection and Separation
Create a system to detect and separate languages in code-mixed text commonly used in Bangladeshi social media.

### 4. Query Intent Classification for Digital Financial Services
Build a multi-class classification model to identify user intents from queries in both Bangla and English for a mobile financial service provider.

## Evaluation Criteria:

- Code quality and organization
- Effectiveness of the NLP techniques employed
