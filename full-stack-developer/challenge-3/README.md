## Challenge 3: Real-time Chat Application

### Scenario:
You're developing a customer support chat system for a local bank in Bangladesh. The system needs to handle real-time communication and work efficiently even on slower internet connections.

### Task:
Create a full-stack real-time chat application that:
1. Allows users to send and receive messages in real-time
2. Supports both text and image messages
3. Implements a "typing" indicator
4. Stores chat history in a database
5. Allows users to view their chat history when they return to the application

### Technical Requirements:
- Use React for the front-end
- Use Node.js and Express.js for the back-end
- Use Socket.io for real-time communication
- Use MongoDB to store chat history
- Implement proper error handling and reconnection logic for unstable connections

### Expected Output:
A full-stack application with both client-side and server-side code. Include a README with setup and running instructions.
