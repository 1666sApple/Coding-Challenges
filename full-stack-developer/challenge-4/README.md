## Challenge 4: Payment Integration for Local Payment Gateways

### Scenario:
You're working on an e-commerce platform that needs to integrate with popular Bangladeshi payment gateways like bKash and Nagad, as well as international options like Paypal.

### Task:
Develop a payment module that:
1. Provides a unified API for different payment gateways
2. Implements the integration for at least two payment gateways (you can mock the actual gateway APIs)
3. Handles payment status updates and webhooks
4. Includes proper error handling and logging
5. Implements a simple UI for users to choose and interact with different payment methods

### Technical Requirements:
- Use Node.js and Express.js for the back-end
- Use React for the front-end payment UI
- Implement proper security measures for handling sensitive payment information
- Use a database (SQL or NoSQL) to store transaction records
- Include unit tests for critical payment processing functions

### Expected Output:
A full-stack payment module including:
- Back-end code for payment processing and gateway integration
- Front-end components for payment method selection and handling
- Database schema for transaction records
- README with setup instructions and documentation on how to add new payment gateways
