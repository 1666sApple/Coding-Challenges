## Challenge 1: Responsive Product Listing Page

### Scenario:
You're developing an e-commerce platform for local artisans in Bangladesh. The platform needs to work well on both desktop and mobile devices, considering the prevalence of mobile internet usage in the country.

### Task:
Create a responsive product listing page that:
1. Fetches product data from a provided API endpoint
2. Displays products in a grid layout on desktop and a single column on mobile
3. Implements lazy loading for images to optimize performance on slower connections
4. Includes a simple filter functionality (e.g., by category or price range)
5. Implements a "Add to Cart" feature with local storage to persist cart items

### Technical Requirements:
- Use React for the front-end
- Implement responsive design using CSS (you can use a framework like Tailwind CSS if you prefer)
- Use fetch or axios for API calls
- Implement proper error handling for API requests

### API Endpoint:
`https://api.example.com/products` (you can mock this endpoint for the challenge)

### Expected Output:
A fully functional React component or set of components that fulfill the above requirements. Include any necessary CSS files.
