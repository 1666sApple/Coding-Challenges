# Coding Challenges for Technology Roles in Bangladesh

Welcome to our coding challenge repository! This collection of challenges is designed to assess candidates for various technology roles, with a focus on addressing real-world problems relevant to Bangladesh's unique technological landscape and business needs.

## Overview

This repository contains coding challenges for three distinct roles:

1. NLP Engineer
2. Full Stack Developer
3. AI/ML Engineer

Each role has its own set of challenges tailored to the specific skills and knowledge required for that position.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
/
├──nlp-specialist/
│   ├── challenge1/
│   ├── challenge2/
│   ├── challenge3/
│   └── challenge4/
├── full-stack-development/
│   ├── challenge1/

└── README.md (this file)
```

Each role-specific directory contains four challenges, and each challenge has its own subdirectory with a detailed README and any necessary resources.

## How to Participate

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Choose the directory corresponding to the role you're applying for.
3. Read the README.md file in that directory for role-specific instructions.
4. Create a new branch for your solutions.
5. Implement your solutions in the appropriate challenge directories.
6. Commit your changes and push to your forked repository.
7. Create a pull request to this repository when you're ready to submit.

## General Guidelines

- Ensure your code is well-documented and follows best practices for the language and frameworks you're using.
- Include clear instructions on how to run your code and any dependencies required.
- If a challenge requires data, use publicly available datasets or provide synthetic data if using real data is not possible due to privacy concerns.
- Consider scalability, performance, and security in your solutions where applicable.
- Demonstrate your problem-solving approach and thought process through comments and documentation.

## Evaluation Criteria

While specific criteria vary by role, all submissions will be evaluated on:

1. Code quality and organization
2. Effectiveness of the solution in addressing the challenge
3. Consideration of Bangladesh-specific contexts and challenges
4. Innovation and creativity in approach
5. Documentation and explanation of design decisions
6. Adherence to best practices in software development

## Time Frame

You have two days from the date you receive these challenges to submit your solutions. Quality is more important than quantity, so it's better to submit well-thought-out solutions for fewer challenges than rushed attempts at all of them.


## Questions and Clarifications

If you have any questions or need clarifications about the challenges, please open an issue in this repository. We'll respond as quickly as possible.

## Conclusion

We're excited to see your innovative solutions to these challenges! Remember, the goal is not just to solve the problem, but to demonstrate your skills, thought process, and ability to create solutions that could work in real-world scenarios in Bangladesh.

Good luck, and happy coding!
