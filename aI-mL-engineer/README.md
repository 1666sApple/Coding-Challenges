# AI/ML Engineering Coding Challenges for Bangladesh Context

This repository contains four coding challenges designed to test AI/ML engineering skills in the context of Bangladesh's industrial landscape, with a focus on the garment industry. Each challenge covers different aspects of AI/ML development, from data preprocessing to model development and deployment.

## Challenges:

1. Data Preprocessing for Multilingual Garment Orders
2. Time Series Forecasting for Production Planning
3. Agentic Workflow for Quality Control
4. LLM Fine-tuning for Compliance Checking

## How to Participate:

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new branch for your solution
3. Implement your solution in the appropriate challenge directory
4. Create a pull request to this repository

## Challenge Details:

### 1. Data Preprocessing for Multilingual Garment Orders
Develop a data preprocessing pipeline to handle order data from international buyers in multiple languages (English, Bangla, Hindi, Chinese) for input into an LLM.

### 2. Time Series Forecasting for Production Planning
Create a time series model to forecast daily production output for a garment factory, considering factors like worker attendance, power availability, and seasonal trends.

### 3. Agentic Workflow for Quality Control
Design and implement a simple agentic workflow system for quality control in a garment production line, capable of making decisions and escalating issues to human supervisors when necessary.

### 4. LLM Fine-tuning for Compliance Checking
Develop a script to fine-tune a pre-trained LLM for checking compliance with Bangladesh labor laws and international standards in the garment industry.

## Evaluation Criteria:

- Code quality, organization, and best practices
- Effectiveness of the AI/ML techniques employed
- Handling of Bangladesh-specific challenges (e.g., multilingual data, infrastructure constraints)
- Model performance and scalability considerations
- Creativity in addressing industry-specific problems
- Documentation and explanation of approach

## Submission Guidelines:

- Ensure your code is well-commented and follows PEP 8 style guide for Python
- Include a detailed README in each challenge directory with:
  - Your approach and methodology
  - Technologies, libraries, and frameworks used
  - Instructions for setting up the environment and running your code
  - Any assumptions made or limitations of your implementation
  - Results and performance metrics (where applicable)
- If using any pre-trained models or external datasets, provide clear instructions on how to obtain and use them
- Include requirements.txt or environment.yml file for dependency management

## Additional Notes:

- Consider the constraints of computing resources typically available in Bangladesh's garment industry
- Pay attention to the interpretability of your models, as this is crucial for industry adoption
- Think about how your solutions could be practically implemented in a production environment

Good luck! We're excited to see your innovative AI/ML solutions addressing these challenges in Bangladesh's garment industry context.
